DESCRIPTION:

In this task required us to build a predictive model using *scikit-learn*, a widely used machine learning library in Python. The model had to perform classification or prediction using a given dataset, such as spam detection, diabetes prediction, or student performance classification.

We began by selecting a dataset (from sources like Kaggle or UCI) and loading it using pandas. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder), and scaling features with StandardScaler.

We split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split, and trained a model like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Decision Tree depending on the problem type. After training, we evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

Our results were plotted using matplotlib and seaborn to show performance metrics and data distribution. We also performed cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well and optionally used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

This task introduced us to the complete machine learning pipeline: from dataset preparation to model training, evaluation, and optimization. We used Jupyter Notebook for the entire workflow, making it easy to document the steps and visualize outputs. This task was a strong foundation in ML concepts and showed us how Python is used in predictive analytics and AI.
